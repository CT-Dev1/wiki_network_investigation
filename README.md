# wiki_network_investigation
Final programming assignment to perform indepth network analysis of wikipedia editing data

This project uses computational thinking and programming skills to answer empirical social science questions related to wikipedia editing data. It uses best practices in programming (and received a (1:1) mark of 82%) in criteria related to modularity, efficiency, algorithm design and legibility. In practice, it demonstrates mastery of loops, conditionals, functions, and awareness of issues related to computational complexity and runtime optimization.   

The project studies reverts on Wikipedia. A revert occurs when an editor undoes the changes made by another editor. We will first identify who reverted whom and when, then identify situations in which if $A$ reverted $B$, $B$ reverted $A$ within 24 hours, and finally, study the difference in seniority between $A$ and $B$. I was restricted in some packages and could not use pandas and was only allowed to use simple modules such as pickle, random, datetime, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. 

In this repo, you'll find my solution to the questions posed for the investigation and the full instructions I was given. This was completed 100% in python.
